# Cultures Map Development Kit

A development kit for maps of cultures games (Northland and 8th wonder of the world).
It allows the creation of internal maps without the internal editor using only the included one (normal editor).
It is a Visual Studio Code extension that gives you syntax highlighting of the ini-files as well as some support.
You can create the terrain in the normal editor and export it (and the ini content) from the map file for you to use.

You might want to put a game.ini file in the root directory of your game:
```
gfx_fullscreen 0
gfx_screen_width 1024
gfx_screen_height 768
fx_off
dm_off
cda_off
game_pre_stuff_skip
```
